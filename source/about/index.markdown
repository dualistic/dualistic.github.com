Pol Llovet: blurb about me.

## Technology

This site uses CSS3 heavily, partly because I was interested in seeing how it worked and partly because it was the easiest way to get what I wanted out of the look and feel of the site. It probably doesn't look right in your browser. It should not load in IE at all.

The fonts are from the google open font directory, so they are free to re-use. I wanted the site to look unique, and haven't noticed many people using the open fonts.

It is built using Sinatra, with a simple bloggy thing (that I call a notebook) shoehorned in. The site templates use sass and haml (as is right and proper). It is in a git repo, but not yet public as I am not ready to share. I will eventually host it, but I want to get the tests working properly (I want to use RSpec, but getting it to play nice with my rack stack took too long), extract the notebook portion into its own middleware, and clean it up.

The notebook uses sqlite3 for the database, but I would like to transition to using a Yogo datastore for fun.

## Atheism

I am an Atheist. Publicly I am convinced that God is not a good explanation for anything, and as such, does not exist. This I will debate happily with anyone. Privately I am an anti-theist, I believe that the presence of religion does more harm than good. I will generally not debate this with people as it only serves to inflame tempers.

## The Logo

The site logo deserves some bit of explanation. When I was a young boy, tromping about the wilds of Montana, I got myself involved in tabletop RPGs. Though my group never did play it, I was enthralled by Ars Magica. I liked everything about it (and always hoped that a video game would pop up to bring Mythic Europe to life). Anyway, one of the details in Ars Magica is that each mage has a Sigil. A symbol that represents their citizenship in the society of Wizards. I spent many classtime hours doodling potential sigils for myself, but I usually ended up borrowing symbols that appeared in my weekly tabletop adventures. Symbols from the Warhammer universe were common.

Sometime in the midst of high school I doodled a stylized infinity symbol inside of a ships wheel. I became very attached to this symbol for reasons that I cannot explain. I used it to represent myself while I fumbled my way through adolescence, trying to figure out who I was and where I fit into my future.

As I stumbled through college bouncing from engineering to philosophy (and anything that struck my fancy), I found myself particularly enjoying Religious Studies. I think it was mostly the excellent professor (Linda Sexon), but also I was in the throes of my personal existential "what does it all mean" phase. It was during this time that I fixated on dualism, and on a whim registered this domain. As part of my coursework I was required to study the books of Elaine Pagels the world's foremost Gnostic scholar. You might imagine my surprise at leafing through the first few pages of The Gnostic Gospels and finding the very symbol that I had been doodling for years. At the time (and given my background reading farmboy-saves-the-world fantasy novels) I interpreted this to mean all manner of things. Perhaps I was a (the) Gnostic? Was this my mysterious and hidden calling? Would an estranged aunt mysteriously appear bearing dire news of my imminent fate?

I did some waiting and some hunting, and came up with nothing. As I grew older, fewer and fewer of the spiritual beliefs of my youth held up to rational scrutiny. Now, I live my life as a convinced Atheist; I don't believe in fate or the supernatural. How then do I explain the coincidence? I explain it as just that, a coincidence. It is a simple symbol, and it's not that surprising that someone also decided that it had merit. I still have no idea why that symbol is used in the title of the Gnostic Gospels, if anyone does, please send me an email. My best guess is that it represents the eight Aeons of Gnosticism (though that is little more than a hunch based on similar symbols I have found related to Gnosticism).

The upshot of this story is twofold. First, the reason for the logo is that it is part of my history. Second, the particular shape of the logo is borrowed from the book. I don't know who owns it, I am hoping that it is buried in some Gnostic text and as such is not copyrightable. Heck, I don't know if symbols can even be copyrighted. Certainly logos can be trademarked, but... Anyway, I am going to keep using it until someone tells me I can't. I like the symbol, and I like the symbolism. I like how it represents the dualism of my life (youth and adulthood), the dualism of my loves (rationality and fantasy), and the oft-misinterpreted religious experience of coincidence which has caused so much trouble throughout history.
