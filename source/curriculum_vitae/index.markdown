## I like...

...to work on interesting projects, with interesting people. I like programming, but I am skilled at a variety of management and communications tasks as well. I like nothing more than to help a capable team get things done. This is what I like best.

"Curriculum Vitae" might sound excessively snooty, but I like it better than "Resum√©" since it means "the flow of life". This is more what I want to capture on this page, not just: I did this thing and then that thing and so on.

## Currently...

Lead Software Engineer,

Research Computing Group, Center for Computational Biology, MT State University, Bozeman, MT

I was a lead prototype developer on the Yogo Research Software Team. I also helped start the Research Computing Group at MSU with my amazing boss Dr. Gwen Jacobs. We are working on the problem of scientific data management, one that is becoming increasingly more critical as the amount of research data produced increases exponentially.
