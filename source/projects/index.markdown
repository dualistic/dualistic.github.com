These are the projects that I work on day to day. They are in some particular order.

### Yogo

The Yogo Project.

### Crux

The Crux Experiment Management system.

### FAD

The faculty activity database (being re-designed).

### Outliner

A simple outliner written in Ruby to make outlining papers easier. I am noodling around with the idea of turning this into a little webapp.

### FileDrop

Simple file upload application (needs updates badly).

### Dualistic.com

This website. A small Sinatra application with an embedded weblog. I would like to spin the blog portion off into its own sinatra app that can be included as rack middleware. I think this would be pretty easy, but I haven't gotten around to it yet.
